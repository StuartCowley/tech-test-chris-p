# :moon: React Technical Test/NASA Image Search - Manchester Codes - Chris Peakin - Oct 2021 Cohort :moon:

## Purpose of the Technical Test

What has been requested as part of this technical test is to create a simple App which receives a search term from the user, and then uses that term to return pictures from NASA's own database and shows them to the user.

## Installing, testing and running the App

Firstly, clone the repo and run `npm i` to install the required dependencies.

Run `npm start` in your terminal, and the App will compile on localhost 3000 and your browser will open automatically.

Run `npm test` to run the tests if desired.

The instructions for running the App are very simple and are displayed in your browser. All you have to do is enter a search term and hit the `Tally Ho!` button.

## Packages used to make and test the App

This App was created using React, PropTypes and Axios. Jest has been used to perform the testing. Links are provided below.

## Further developments for the App

If possible, one small thing I'd like to add is a number to each of the images.
